# Portanic APIs and Common Configuration Definitions

This repository defines component-level APIs and common configuration formats for the Portanic platform. These definitions are specified using the [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) syntax.

## API Guidelines

When making changes to the protos in this repository, your changes **must** comply with the [API guidelines](./GUIDELINES.md).

## Updating

After the [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) definitions
are updated, the corresponding `*pb.go`, `_pb2.py`, `*.json` and
Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition files must be
generated by running `just gen` and submitted as
part of the same PR as the updated definitions. Also `just
gen` will update the proto.lock file with new changes.
